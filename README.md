# Firebase SDK for Desktop environments

**All credit goes to the [official Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com)**

A light wrapper around the public firebase REST / gRPC apis

Inspiration: With Kotlin-Multiplatform and Compose Desktop becoming more popular,
I found myself in great need of a firestore desktop implementation
and since there was no such thing, other than the official Admin Sdk, 
I was forced to use the public REST & gRPC apis, and implement one myself.
